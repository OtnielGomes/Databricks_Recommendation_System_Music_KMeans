# Databricks Music recommendation system

Hello, the challenge of this project is to improve the existing music recommendation system, but which only takes song genres into account. we will use clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. To do this, we will use some PySpark modules, such as SQL, to manipulate the data, and Machine Learning, which will allow the use of various tools aimed at clustering solutions.

I will create a function that, having a reference song, will return a playlist. This playlist will be presented with album covers and song names.

# The Database:

* [Data](https://github.com/OtnielGomes/Databricks_Recommendation_System_Music_KMeans/tree/main/Data)
* [Data source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset?resource=download)

### Note: I recommend using the Databricks tool for better visualization of the data and the project.For the notebook to work properly, you will need to adjust the database directories according to its location on your local machine or in the ''FileStore" in your Databricks account.
